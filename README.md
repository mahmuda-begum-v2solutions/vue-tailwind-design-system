## üõ† TypeScript Users

If you see a TypeScript warning like:

```bash
Could not find a declaration file for module 'vue-tailwind-design-system'.
```

Don‚Äôt worry ‚Äî the types are included and working correctly. This warning may appear if your environment doesn‚Äôt fully support exports field resolution in package.json.

### ‚úÖ Workaround

You can explicitly map the type using a paths entry in your consumer project‚Äôs tsconfig.json:

```bash
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "paths": {
      "vue-tailwind-design-system": [
        "node_modules/vue-tailwind-design-system/dist/vue-tailwind-design-system.es.js"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Or, you can safely ignore the warning ‚Äî everything will still work correctly at build time and in most IDEs like VSCode.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è About Vite Export Warning

When building this library, you might see:

```bash
‚ñ≤ [WARNING] The condition "types" here will never be used...
```

This is a known behavior in Vite when using exports fields in package.json. The warning does not affect type resolution in projects using this package and is safe to ignore.
